# Employee Management 

## Project description ðŸ‘‡

To build a full employee management system using React and Node. We'll start by creating a simple database using MySQL and then build a React app that contains all the logic for managing employees. We'll also use Axios to send employee data to the database and learn how to create a custom JWT tokenizer for authentication. Last, we'll create a router to serve our employee management system and make use of hash functions to encrypt employee data


Full-stack React + Node.js + Express + MySQL example with a CRUD Application. The back-end server uses Node.js + Express for REST APIs, front-end side is a React.js client with React Router, Axios & Bootstrap.
