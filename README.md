# Employee Management 

## Project description ðŸ‘‡

To build a full employee management system using React and Node. We'll start by creating a simple database using MySQL and then build a React app that contains all the logic for managing employees. We'll also use Axios to send employee data to the database and learn how to create a custom JWT tokenizer for authentication. Last, we'll create a router to serve our employee management system and make use of hash functions to encrypt employee data
